As an Artificial Intelligence Internee I'm uploading my assigned tasks here. 
My first Task is about the TIC_TAC_TOE_WITH_AI using minimax algorithm in it using computer language-> Python in it.
second task is about chatbot where i used simple Chatbot with pre-defined if-else statements to give appropriate responses to the users. It consists of the libraries such as NLTK(Natural Language Toolkit) which is basically used in Natural Language Processing in Python.This Program consists of:
->library: NLTK
->class: Sentiment Intensity Analyzer used for sentiment analysis
->function: Chatbot-response with if-else statements
->User-Input of Basic statements
In summary, this script defines a simple rule-based and sentiment-aware chatbot that responds to greetings, farewells, and general sentiments in the user's input. The chatbot continues to interact with the user until 'exit' is typed.
third task Created a Recommendation System for Food using the collaborative filtering in it.
summary of the code:
libraries: 
-pandas->data manipulation
- cosine_similarity: calculating similarity 
-TfidfVectorizer: text feature extraction
function:
-collaborative recommendations(retrieves user ratings, identifies dishes user already rated, calculates avg, recommends)
1-created a csv files of ratings and dish details in python environment.
